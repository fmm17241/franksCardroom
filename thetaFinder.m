% Trying an idea from advisors/Yargo: We have transceiver orientation as
% compared to 0N rose, done, constant. For each hour timestep, we have the
% angle at which the tides are flowing compared to 0N rose; comparing the
% two will let us know when the tides are parallel or perpendicular to the
% known transceiver angle (+/- a few degrees, TBD).


%Idea: Tide is XX degrees, Transceivers are oriented forever at YY

% thetaHourly = YY-XX
% closeNuff = thetaHourly < 5 & thetaHourly >-5
