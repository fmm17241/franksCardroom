%Frank getting serious about last chapter. Needs extensive work but looking
%to build off the 2021 WUWnet paper. I'm considering working in Python,
%I'll build my environmental data here then use Python to plot/model.

% Required steps:
% 1. Collect/Create environmental data as a medium for acousticp ropagation
%
% 2. Separate the data into single glider yos (yoDefiner or something)
%
% 3. Convert the yo into a sound speed profile (SSP), and format it into a
%       *.env file to feed into Bellhop.
